Have the goland-dev, architect, and code-reviewer each read the task descriptions for this phase and consider the changes made (which you can see with 'git diff main') as well as the code in general. They should consider whether the code implement the task requirements? Is it clear? Is it concise? Are there any security issues? Combine their results and generate a 'final-review.md' file with a summary of the findings and then a '## TODO' section that enumerates the combined changes suggested by the agent reviews.
